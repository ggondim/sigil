/**
 * Ownership origin resolution (P7) — shared by the WRITE side (fact store
 * stamping `created_by_origin`) and the READ side (owner-scoped visibility in
 * search). Both MUST use the same identity or private facts would be stamped
 * with one id and filtered with another.
 *
 * Precedence (mirrors the prior P2 read-side resolution):
 *   1. the authenticated RPC caller's device id (request-context ALS) — set
 *      for paired remote devices, so a remote reader/writer uses its own id.
 *   2. ctx.device.id, if a caller threaded one explicitly.
 *   3. the local install id from config.json (`device.id`, a UUID) — the
 *      common local-CLI / hooks case; this is what makes each PERSON's writes
 *      distinguishable in a shared DB.
 * Returns the id as a string (the column is TEXT), or null when nothing
 * resolves (fail-open: writes leave it NULL → globally visible, never hidden).
