# Cortex

**Persistent memory for Claude Code — local-first, zero-cloud.**

Every AI coding session starts from zero. Cortex fixes that.
Your architecture decisions, coding preferences, past bugs, and project context — remembered across every session, every tool, every day.

## The problem

Every time you open Claude Code, it starts from zero.
It doesn't remember your codebase, your decisions, or the conversation you had yesterday.

You end up:
- Re-explaining the same architecture over and over
- Watching Claude repeat the same mistakes you corrected last week
- Losing hours to context-loading that should be instant

## The solution

Cortex is a **local knowledge engine** that gives Claude Code persistent memory.
It plugs in via Claude Code hooks and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — so memory works invisibly:

- **Every prompt** → Cortex injects relevant facts before Claude answers
- **Every edit / command** → Cortex silently captures the observation
- **Every session** → Full project context is already there

No cloud. No subscription. No API key required (with Claude Code subscription).

---

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @anmol-srv/cortex

# One-time setup (30 seconds)
cortex init

# That's it. Open Claude Code and start a new session.
```

`cortex init` runs an interactive wizard that:
1. Asks for your LLM provider (Claude Code subscription is default — zero API key needed)
2. Sets up a local PGlite database at `~/.cortex/db` (no Docker, no Postgres server)
3. Registers hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` so Claude auto-uses memory
4. Adds `@~/.cortex/CLAUDE.md` to your global Claude config

No other steps. No cloud setup.

```bash
# Verify everything works
cortex doctor
```

```
Cortex diagnostic

  ✓ Config file — ~/.cortex/.env
  ✓ Database — PGlite (~/.cortex/db)
  ✓ Stored data — 53 docs, 47 chunks, 249 facts
  ✓ LLM provider — claude-cli (Claude Code subscription)
  ✓ Embedding provider — ollama / nomic-embed-text
  ✓ UserPromptSubmit hook — registered
  ✓ PostToolUse hook — registered
  ✓ Cortex CLAUDE.md — ~/.cortex/CLAUDE.md

All checks passed.
```

## How it works

Cortex is three layers of knowledge, not a flat vector store:

| Layer | What's stored | Good for |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Chunks** | 512-token text blocks with contextual prefixes and embeddings | "Show me the relevant section" |
| **Facts** | LLM-extracted atomic statements — categorized, deduplicated, temporally tracked | "What do we know about X?" |
| **Entity graph** | Typed nodes (people, topics, documents) with relationships | "What's related to this?" |

### The ingestion pipeline

Every document goes through 6 stages:

```
Content → Classify → Dedup Check → Parse → Chunk + Embed → Extract Facts (AUDM) → Link Entities
```

- **Classify** — LLM decides: `thought` (fast-path) / `knowledge` (full pipeline) / `noise` (skip)
- **Dedup check** — SHA-256 hash skips unchanged content
- **Parse** — Format-aware parsers: markdown, text, html, code, json
- **Chunk + embed** — 512-token chunks with contextual prefixes, vectorized via Ollama or OpenAI
- **Extract facts (AUDM)** — LLM extracts atomic facts. For each fact, the **AUDM pipeline** (Add/Update/Delete/Merge) checks similarity against existing facts and decides: skip the duplicate, update the old version, contradict the stale one, or add as new.
- **Link entities** — 3-stage entity resolution (exact → embedding + LLM verify → create) builds a knowledge graph

### The search pipeline

```
Query → Cognitive Router → (Vector + Keyword) → RRF Merge → Graph Enhancement → Results
```

- **Cognitive router** — Classifies query intent (preference / factual / entity_lookup / exploratory / temporal)
- **Hybrid search** — Vector (semantic) + keyword (exact match) merged via Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **Graph enhancement** — For exploratory queries, traverses entity graph to surface related facts

Results in ~30ms on a knowledge base of thousands of facts.

## Claude Code integration

Cortex integrates with Claude Code in three complementary ways:

### 1. Hooks (automatic, invisible)

`cortex init` registers two hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **`UserPromptSubmit`** — On every user prompt, searches Cortex for relevant facts and injects them as `additionalContext`. Claude sees the memory automatically.
- **`PostToolUse`** — On every Edit/Write/Bash, captures a lightweight observation in the background.

No `! cortex search` or `! cortex remember` commands needed. Memory is invisible.

### 2. Hot context (passive)

`cortex init` writes a top-20 hot-facts snapshot to `~/.cortex/CLAUDE.md`, auto-imported into every Claude session via `@~/.cortex/CLAUDE.md` in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Facts are ranked by importance × access count × recency.

Refreshed automatically after every `cortex remember` and `cortex ingest`. Manual refresh:

```bash
cortex context
```

### 3. MCP tools (on-demand)

Cortex registers as an MCP server with 7 tools for deep knowledge access:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search` | Hybrid search across all facts and chunks |
| `search_entity` | Find entities by name or type |
| `traverse_graph` | Navigate entity relationships (neighbors / path / related) |
| `get_fact_context` | Full detail on a fact (provenance, source document, entities) |
| `get_entity_context` | Full detail on an entity (relations, facts, mentions) |
| `status` | Knowledge base statistics |
| `ingest` | Ingest content via Claude |

To register:

```bash
cortex register
```

## Providers

Cortex supports four LLM providers with automatic detection:

| Provider | API key needed | Cost | Notes |
|----------|---------------|------|-------|
| **Claude Code** (`claude-cli`) | **No** — uses your existing subscription | Free with subscription | Default. Piggybacks on Claude Code auth |
| **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | ~$0.15 / 1M input tokens (gpt-4o-mini) | Cheapest API option |
| **Anthropic** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | ~$0.80 / 1M input tokens (Haiku) | Direct Anthropic access |
| **Ollama** | None | Free (local) | Fully offline, uses your machine |

Embeddings:

| Provider | API key | Model | Dimensions | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Ollama** (default) | None | `nomic-embed-text` | 768 | Free, local. MTEB ~62. |
| **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `text-embedding-3-small` / `-large` | 1536 / 3072 (truncatable to 1024) | Best quality/cost balance. Set `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1024` for the truncated `-large`. |
| **Voyage** | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | `voyage-3-large` | 1024 | MTEB ~76, Anthropic-recommended. Free tier covers most personal use. |

Auto-detection waterfall (LLM):
1. Explicit `LLM_PROVIDER` env var wins
2. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set → Anthropic
3. `OPENAI_API_KEY` set → OpenAI
4. Ollama reachable → Ollama
5. `claude` CLI installed → Claude Code subscription

Auto-detection waterfall (embeddings):
1. Explicit `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` env var wins
2. `VOYAGE_API_KEY` set → Voyage
3. Ollama reachable → Ollama
4. `OPENAI_API_KEY` set → OpenAI

Per-task overrides via `provider:model` syntax:

```bash
LLM_EXTRACTION_MODEL=claude-cli:haiku     # cheap extraction
LLM_DECISION_MODEL=anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6  # accurate AUDM decisions
```

---

## Storage

Cortex defaults to **PGlite** — embedded WASM Postgres in `~/.cortex/db/`. No server, no port, no Docker. Right choice for personal single-developer use.

For Postico/pgAdmin visibility, multi-process concurrency, or shared deployments, switch to **real Postgres**:

```
# ~/.cortex/.env
CORTEX_DB_TYPE=postgres
CORTEX_DB_HOST=localhost
CORTEX_DB_PORT=5432
CORTEX_DB_NAME=cortex
CORTEX_DB_USER=cortex_app
CORTEX_DB_PASSWORD=...
```

Then `cortex migrate` to create the schema in your Postgres instance.

Full setup walkthrough (Homebrew, Docker, troubleshooting): [`docs/postgres.md`](docs/postgres.md).

PGlite limitations to be aware of:
- Single process at a time (multiple cortex CLI invocations or a CLI alongside an MCP server can collide). If a hard kill leaves the DB unreachable: `cortex doctor --kill-stale`.
- Not visible to standard Postgres tools (Postico, pgAdmin, psql). Switch to real Postgres for those.

## Files Cortex owns

```
~/.cortex/
├── .env              # Config, API keys (if any), namespace
├── db/               # PGlite embedded database (auto-created)
└── CLAUDE.md         # Instructions + hot-context snapshot for Claude

~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md         # @import line to ~/.cortex/CLAUDE.md (one line added)
└── settings.json     # UserPromptSubmit + PostToolUse hooks (merged, not overwritten)
```

Everything lives under `~/.cortex/`. No files in your project directory. No cloud. No external services (except Ollama for embeddings if you choose it).

## FAQ

**Q: Does Cortex work with Cursor / Windsurf / other MCP clients?**
A: The MCP interface works with any MCP client. The hooks are Claude Code specific. Cursor integration requires manual MCP registration.

**Q: Does my data leave my machine?**
A: No. Everything runs locally by default (PGlite + Ollama). If you pick the OpenAI or Anthropic LLM provider, the text sent for fact extraction leaves your machine during ingestion. Embeddings with Ollama stay local. Claude Code provider uses your existing subscription without extra data egress.

**Q: Can I back up my knowledge base?**
A: Yes. `cortex export --format=json --output=backup.json` exports all facts, entities, and documents. Or copy `~/.cortex/db/` to another machine.

**Q: What happens when my knowledge base gets large?**
A: Vector search on pgvector stays fast up to millions of vectors. Tested with thousands of facts without noticeable slowdown. Use namespaces to scope search when relevant.

**Q: Can I share a knowledge base with a team?**
A: Not yet. v1 is single-user. Team features (shared namespaces, sync) are planned for v2.

**Q: How do I debug when something breaks?**
A: Start with `cortex doctor`. It'll tell you exactly what's wrong — missing provider, hook not registered, DB issue, etc.
