# =============================================================================
# Setup / Bootstrap Script for autoducks
# =============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE
# -------
# Validates that the current repository is ready to run the agentic workflows,
# and creates what can be automated (labels). Things that require GitHub App
# install or org-level permissions are reported as manual checklist items.
#
# USAGE
#   ./scripts/setup.sh [--repo OWNER/REPO]
#
# CHECKS
#   1. gh CLI authentication
#   2. Required labels (feature, smoke-test, priority:P0-P3) — CREATES if missing
#   3. CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN secret — reports if missing
#   4. Repository Actions workflow permissions — reports if wrong
#   5. Claude Code GitHub App installation — reports if missing
#   6. Issue types (Feature, Task) at the org level — reports if missing
#   7. Runtime workflow sync — verifies .autoducks/runtimes match .github/workflows
